# Lyric Trivia Game

## Description:
Lyric trivia will test the music knowledge of even the biggest music fans out there. The user is allowed to choose from 6 different categories : The Beatles, Justin Bieber, Beyonce/Destiny's Child, Today's Hits, 2000's Pop, 90's Pop. The game will then present a short snippet of the lyrics of a randomly selected song from the category chosen. The user then has a choice to make, either guess the song based on the snippet given for 10 points or see more of the lyrics for at the cost of 5 points. After this the user will again have a choice to guess the song now or get part of the song title at the cost of an additional 3 points. If the user selects to get the hint it will display part of the song and then prompt the user to input their best guess at the song title. If you get it correct at this point you just get 2 points and if at any point you choose to input the answer and donâ€™t get it correct you get 0 points for that turn.
